Programming in C (Assignment – 2)                    Question-1 What do you mean by Structures?  Answer A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows combining variables of different data types under one name The keyword struct is used to define a structure  #include <stdio.h>  struct Student { int roll; char name[20]; float marks; };  int main() { struct Student s1 = {1, "Amit", 88.5};  printf("Roll: %d\n", s1.roll); printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name); printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);  return 0; }                       Output  Roll: 1 Name: Amit Marks: 88.50                   Question-2 What do you mean by Array and Pointer Array?  Answer Array - An array is a collection of similar data types stored in contiguous memory locations Example - int arr[5];  Pointer Array - A pointer array means an array of pointers, where each element stores the address of a variable  #include <stdio.h>  int main() { int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30; int *arr[3];  arr[0] = &a; arr[1] = &b; arr[2] = &c;  printf("Values: %d %d %d", *arr[0], *arr[1], *arr[2]);  return 0; }                       Output  Values: 10 20 30                   Question-3 Compare two structure variables using comparison operators (equal and not equal)  Answer Two structures cannot be compared directly using == or != We must compare their members individually using conditional statements  #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h>  struct Student { int roll; char name[20]; };  int main() {  struct Student s1 = {1, "Amit"};  struct Student s2 = {2, "Amit"};   if (s1.roll == s2.roll && strcmp(s1.name, s2.name) == 0)  printf("Structures are Equal");  else  printf("Structures are Not Equal");  return 0; }                     Output  Structures are Not Equal                 Question-4 Perform arithmetic operations on structures  Answer Arithmetic operations cannot be performed directly on entire structure variables, but they can be performed on individual numeric members of the structure  #include <stdio.h>  struct Numbers { int a; int b; };  int main() { struct Numbers n1 = {10, 20}; struct Numbers n2 = {5, 15}; struct Numbers result;  result.a = n1.a + n2.a; result.b = n1.b - n2.b;  printf("Addition of a = %d\n", result.a); printf("Subtraction of b = %d\n", result.b);  return 0; }                      Output  Addition of a = 15 Subtraction of b = 5
